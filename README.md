# Trees-Visualization
Visualization of every tree in Boston.  Data from data.boston.gov, visualized with bokeh.datashader, a Python 3 library.

# Data
Data is in a CSV file, available here: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/trees

# Library
I followed the readme on datashaders github for this project: https://github.com/bokeh/datashader

# Results
![A map of every tree in boston](https://github.com/jamesdesmond/Trees-Visualization/blob/master/output.png?raw=true)

# What I learned
I didn't know how to do any visualizations prior to this project.  I learned how to parse large CSV datasets of GPS coordinates and generate a visual representation of them.

# What's next
The CSV set has a column 'Tree Type' That I would like to use as the basis for the color of the visualization.  e.g. Park trees would be green while City trees would be blue.  I think it would make places like Commonwealth Ave or the Boston Common more obvious.
